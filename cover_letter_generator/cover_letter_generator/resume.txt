PROJECTS 

 
Accessible Voting Machine for Visually Impaired Users 
Developed an inclusive voting system using Arduino and ESP8266, enabling voice-command and Braille-based voting. 
Integrated MP3 module for real-time audio prompts via headphones, ensuring private and accessible interaction for 
visually impaired users. 
 
PowerTrack: Electricity Bill Monitoring System 
Designed a hardware-software integrated system that captures electricity bill data via camera, processes it using OCR 
(Tesseract + OpenCV), and displays extracted details (units, amount, due date) on a user-friendly interface. Includes real-
time hardware alerts and dashboard insights to promote timely payments and energy awareness. 
 
Tree Species Detection System 

Built an AI-powered image classification model using CNN (TensorFlow) and OpenCV to detect tree species from 
images of leaves, fruits, or full trees. Designed an intuitive interface to display species names with reference 
visuals, supporting environmental education and biodiversity tracking.
